## What problem does using exports solve?
It solved using multiple scripts linked to the HTML.  This affects page performance and disrupts further processing while it runs.  It is also bad practice.
## How does export differ from export default?
With export, you can have multiple named exports per file.  With export default, you can have only one per file.
## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
Overall, it is a better way of organizing code.  It allows you to split your code up into smaller files which can make labeling easier since a function having the same name will be specified by aliases.  Debugging becomes easier to pin point issues and multiple scripts can by concatenated which increases performance.
