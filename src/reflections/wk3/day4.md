# Day 4 | WORKING IN MVC WITH COMPLEX DATA, ARRAY METHODS

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
When a page needs multiple elements the need to be in sync, it is easy to write numerous one-to-many, one-way, and event-driven data bindings. This leads to the code having a lot of 'push and pull'.  The Observer Pattern seeks to solve this.
## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
The subscribe method, the unsubscribe method and the broadcast method.

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
  To my understanding, the magic of the proxy objects and the observer pattern written into the bcw-template is a fail safe.  It is code written to prevent future headaches and errors with your code.  If a function is not passing the correct parameters or a parameter that isn't passing a value that meets a guideline, it is going to return an error msg declaring what is wrong.
