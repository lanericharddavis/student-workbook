## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
When a page needs multiple elements the need to be in sync, it is easy to write numerous one-to-many, one-way, and event-driven data bindings. This leads to the code having a lot of 'push and pull'.  The Observer Pattern seeks to solve this.
## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
The subscribe method, the unsubscribe method and the broadcast method.
