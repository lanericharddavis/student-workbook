# C# Enum's

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are a value type, so they contain their own value.  Enums are used in two ways, lower case and upper case.  Lower case enum is used to define new enums and use the BCL (Base Class Library) type.  Upper case Enum is used to implement static enum methods.
## How can you modify an Enum?
Enums can be customized by changing the base type and member values.  Another modification that can be made is to set the value of an enum member.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
In our controllers, we have used Enums for declaring a collection of one of our model schemas.
