# Welcome to SQL

## In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

## Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.
```
CREATE TABLE characters
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
```

## What is the difference between the following statements:
```
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
