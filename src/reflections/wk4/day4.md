## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
Representational State Transfer.  It is a architectural style standard between computer systems on the web.  This makes it easier for cross communication.  
## What does Stateless mean?
RESTful systems have a separation of the client side and server side.  This means that one can be independently implemended without the other knowing.

## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
Some patterns used when writing RESTful APIs are somewhat straight forward such as using plural nouns as collection of a resource and the non-plural use would be it's singleton.  Another would be the use of common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
