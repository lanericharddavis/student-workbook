# Day 3 | Asynchronous Code | Async and Await

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
Async/Await is vital in asynchronous programming.  It is what allows the code to keep running while waiting for a response from a specific request.
## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
You must declare that it is an async function.  This says that inside there will be an await which you will return a promise.


## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
Async/Await makes code simpler to read with chaining.  It is also makes for easier debugging because the compiler treats it like synchronous code.
