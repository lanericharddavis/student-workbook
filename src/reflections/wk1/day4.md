# Day 3 Wire-Framing

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
As one would create a storyboard when laying out scenes in a movie or show, wire-framing is used for laying out the basic design and flow of a webpage.  Usually wireframing takes place during the beginning stages of site development and provides those not directly involved in the creation side of things a quick, cheap, understanding of what a potential site could look like.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are three levels of wire-frames.  Each providing a varying level of detail on the webpage layout.<br>
  1) Low-Fidelity: This wire-frame is the most basic and does not include content.  Low-fidelity wire-frames can be drawn out on paper making them an extremely affordable quick option for brainstorming projects to get the creative juices flowing.  These usually include just simple images, block shapes, and mock content or filler text.<br><br>
  2) Mid-Fidelity: This level of wire-framing adds more details to components but still leaves out a majority of styling.  Often times, these are still in black and white and do not include font styling.  Shades of grey are used to differentiate future coloring and text weight to emphasize items.  There are a number available digital wire-framing tools to make up mid-fidelity wire-frames<br><br>
  3) High-Fidelity: This type of wire-framing is usually saved for the later stages of the design cycle.  These often include actual featured images and relevant text.  Like mid-fidelity wire-frames, there are digital tools to help create high-fidelity wire-frames, such as Figma, which can even include interactive menu systems and maps.


## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Wire-framing is 100% worth the time, energy, and effort.  Pending on the size and time commitment of the project, the developer may choose to do either low, mid, or a high-fidelity wire-frame or a combination of them all as the project advances.  What makes wire-frames so appealing is that they are low cost and quick to create and change which are desireable for any stakeholder who likes to see options.
