# Day 2 - HTML/CSS

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A Pseudo-Class indicates that the element requires a specific state to be applied.  Some Pseudo-Classes make your web page more interactive and user-friendly, such as the :hover class which will activate that class when a users pointer is hovering over the element.
## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is a number assigned to elements through css to determine the level of importance of that particular element.  This is set in place in case there are multiple rules applied to the same element and property.
## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
!important tags have the highest level of specificity and therefor forces that particular styling over any other previously determined styling for that element may had.  !important tags can only be overriden by another !important tag.  If the tag is over-utilized, it may cause issues for future developers working on your code if they run into the issue of an element not reponding the way they intended because there is an !important tag somewhere buried elsewhere.
