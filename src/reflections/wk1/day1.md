# Day 1 - Intro to Codeworks

## Why do we use Git?
Git is a system that enables a developer to store content, and provide the user access to "snap-shots" of what the content looked like in prior versions.  It also allows multiple developers to work simutaneously on the same project.
## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Multiple branches are beneficial when there is a need to support multiple parallel developments on the same project.  
## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system mainly used "locally" and GitHub is a cloud based hosting site for managing code "remotely".
