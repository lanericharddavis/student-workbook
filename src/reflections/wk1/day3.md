# Day 3 - Bootstrap

## My favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
So far, my favorite tip for improving design is to plan out page layout before adding content.  When you have the bare bone skeleton of the page in place, the flow and concept of design is much easier to achieve.  

## Resources that might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
The big tech giant's websites such as google and apple are always a solid example of good design.  As far as resources for making design better and simplier to use, bootstrap is an popular source.


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Influencial websites that keep drawing in visitors are the ones that are stream-line, easy on the eyes, and user-friendly to the point of stupidity.  If a child can figure out how to navagate and use a website without prior guidance, that is a well designed website.
