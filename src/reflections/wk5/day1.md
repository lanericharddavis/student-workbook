## What is the purpose of a Query String?
  A query string is another way of passing information to and from a website.  This is done by adding data to the end of the URL in a specific manner.
## What is the format of a query parameter?  How does it start?  How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
  You can tell where a query parameter begins with the '?' in the URL.  Everything after the '?' is part of the query string.  Distinguishing between one parameter and the next is shown with a '&'.
## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
