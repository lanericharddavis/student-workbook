# Course Review

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

As with most of the projects we are assigned, I will most liekly stress throughout this whole assignment.  As to prevent this as much as possible, I plan to break down the project into do-able chunks.  Timeboxing will be critical in order to not spend unnecessary time on errors that could be fixed with a little help.  Also, to take breaks and as to not burnout on the task at hand.
