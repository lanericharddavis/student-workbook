3) Domain Number:  Single, multidomain, and wildcard.

Extended Validation (EV): Are the most expensive.  Show  certain information such as business name and country as to not be mistaken for spam.
Organization Validation (OV SSL): Offer medium level of encryption.  It verifies that your organization and domain validations are real.
Domain Validation (DV): Offers low level encryption (Shown with green padlock next to URL).  Quickest validation.
Wildcard SSL: Fall under the "domain and subdomain number" category.  It ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, it can be used for subdomains within that domain.
Unified Communications (UCC):  Also known as multi-domain.  Allow multiple domain anmes to be on the same certificate.
Single Domain: As you can probably guess, this certificate only protects one domain.  Unlike Wildcard SSLs, Single Domains can not be used to protect subdomains.
