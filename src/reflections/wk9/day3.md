# Scrum for Small Teams

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Some adjustments made from tradational sized scrum teams to smaller teams include expanding the scope of communication between all members of the project by incorporating messaging applications such as Slack.  This allowed communication to be streamlined between developers and product owners and stakeholders.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
Sprints should have very specific time lines and goals.  Product backlog may be refined as needed however no changes should be made that would endanger the sprint goal.  After a sprint, goals should be adjusted accordingly to how the prior sprint resulted.  Thus always growing as a team from the previous sprint.  If multiple sprints were ran at the same time, conflicts could arise that might possibly affect the other and learning opportunities and overall productivity would be deminished.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle is a paradox between the speed of development and the quality of the product delivered.  There are three tenants to this:  GOOD service CHEAP won't be FAST, GOOD service FAST won't be CHEAP, and FAST service CHEAP won't be GOOD.



## Why is communication on a small team important?
Communication is of the utmost importance while working in a small team.  If your team does not have a understanding of what the client wants or even what each team member is doing specifically for a sprint, then clarification must be made.  However, a balance must be made from the get-go because having too many stand-ups or meeting can take away valuable time developing, especially in a small team environment.
