# Capstone Reflection

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using Vue.js and MongoDb with Mongoose.  We also are incorporating GeoJSON with location services.
## What went well so far?
Our team communicates well with each other.  We are always on the same page about who is doing what.  
## What would you do differently? Why?
Have a better structure to our daily stand-ups.  They were productive but probably could have been more efficient.  We also weren't able to appropriately time-box task well since we are all junior developers.  We pair programmed for the most part, however, some of the more challenging tasks were sometimes put on one person to solve while the second of the pair continued coding as to not slow overall productivity.
