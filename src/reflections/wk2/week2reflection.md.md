# Week 2 Refection

## Things Learned This Week
  This week, I scratched the surface of JavaScript.  I am not grasping the material quite as well as I would like, but hopefully with practice and repetition, it will start coming together.

## Things Still Struggling With
I struggle with taking the basic structure of JavaScript, and tying them into each other.  I have a grasp on individual aspects of what things are and how the work, but piecing the whole thing together is still challenging.  Also, I have a hard time optimizing my code, or even seeing how I can write it cleaner, specifically, condensing a large "if, else if" statement into a simple short one that uses dynamic variables.

## Challenges That Were Overcome
  I am starting to understand loops a little better, however, I need to practice utilizing different types of loops.

## Overall Take On Week
Overall, this was a really challenging week for me.  When in lecture, things make sense when they are being explained while they are being built out, but when it comes time to start building it out on my own, I seem to forget everything he went over and everything that made sense earlier is not foreign.  I've been trying to take better notes so I can reference stuff while on my own which is helping a little.  I think I just need more practice... and time in the day.
