# Day 4 | Timeouts, Intervals and Local Storage

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
You don't see construction workers just throwing down bricks to build a house before looking at blueprints.  You don't see authors putting out novels without first coming up with a story plot or rough draft.  As a developer, you shouldn't just start writing down code before you have a plan of what you're doing.
There is usually a process that goes into writing quality code:  Think, research, plan, write, validate and modify.  Planning like this may not be the most important when building little stand-alone programs, but when taking on a large scale project, it becomes almost manditory.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
When I am stuck, I first go through my personal notes to see if I have any information on the topic that I notated in a manner I might understand.  If I have not, then I go to the internet, usually Googling it.  Most of the time, trying to research the issue at hand on MDN Web Docs.  If I still need clarification, I look to w3schools.com or just see if anyone else has a solution to my problem on Stack Overflow.

## From the entire article what are you biggest takeaways?
There are a lot of good takeaways from the article.  The two that stand out most to me are "Reinventing the Wheel" and "Picking the First Solution".  "Reinventing the Wheel" seems obvious but I often find myself struggling over how to write something or solve a problem when there is an ocean of resources at my desposal(the world wide web).  Web development is a unique field of work because there are plenty of open source resources we can use for help. Instead of trying to muscle your way through something, use your resources, maybe there is an easier way of solving your task.  The second takeaway "Picking the First Solution" is mostly because of my novice status.  When writing code, especially code that ACTUALLY WORKS, I am so thrilled about my vicory that I get attached to my code and think this HAS to be the best way to write/solve this.  In reality, most of the time, I just used the most basic way and there are countless better, more efficent ways to produce the same functionality of what I wrote.  In due time, better and more efficient methods will be learned and I will grow as a developer, but that should never stop you from taking a step back from your work and asking yourself, "Is there a way I can make this better?"
