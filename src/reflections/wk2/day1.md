# Day 1 | Intro to JavaScript

## What is Scope?
When thinking of scope, I think of a telescope.  When you look through it, your eye can only see things that are within the view of the scope.  In a sense, this is how scopes with variables work.  It is the area in which that declared variable can work in.
## What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is a mechanism built into JavaScript that is how code is actually interpreted rather than written within their scope.  Hoisting does very much what it sounds like, it hoists or moves variables and function declarations to the top of their scope, not physically, only interpreted when the code is run.

## In what cases might you use <b><em>let</em></b> vs <b><em>const</em></b> vs <b><em>var</em></b>?
