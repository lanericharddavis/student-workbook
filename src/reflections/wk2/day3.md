# Day 3 | Interacting with the DOM and Events

## What are the main ways to write information to the console?  Why/when should you use each style?
From your code, you can insert "console.log(___)". Whatever is in the brackets will appear in your console when the code executes that line.  You can also open up your dev-tools by right-clicking your mouse and clicking inspect, once there, you click on the "Console" tab and can directly write information.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The Elements Tab.  This tab is extremely helpful with building out the layout and styling of the page.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
The "debugger" key word in your code.  This will stop the code from running on that line and let you go step by step through the actions of your code.  You can see when exactly variables/properties get assigned by hovering your pointer over after that step was completed.  Allowing the user to step through the code line by line to see when and why errors are appearing helps the debugging process ten fold.
