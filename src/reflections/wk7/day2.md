# Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an introduction

## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code Documentation is an effective way of describing what is happening with the code or what you want other programmers to know about your code.  This can be done through a ReadMe file, a howtos guide, or probably the best documentation is in directly in the code.
## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
The benefits of code documentation is always having a reminder of what your train of thought was no matter when you revisit the code.  It is also very useful in the case of a seperate programmer looking at your code for the first time without you present to explain your reasoning.  

## How important is Code documentation and why?
Code documentation is important because at the end of the day, code is a machine language and reading or decipher it alone may present challenges, throw in a hot-shot programmer that writes their code in such a way that they are the only ones that understand it and you have a perfect storm.  If that hot-shot threw in documentation, it could make it talerable but you should always write you code in such a way that documentation is almost not necessary.  This can be done with writing proper naming principles.
