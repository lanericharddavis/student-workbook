# Designing a Strong User Experience

## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
User Experience, also know as UX, is the interaction a person has on your website.  A good UX is helping the user do what THEY want to do on your site with as much ease as possible.  The UX should not be about what YOU want the user to do.
## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
Taking the user experience (UX) into account helps break down how you are going to layout the program.  Thinking of the UX early in the development stages can help prevent future headaches and rework.
## Why is the User Experience important?
The better UX that people have on your site, the more they are bound to use it, which will turn them into possible long term users/customers.
