# Partner Project

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
With pair programming, we implemented time-boxing so we each had time as the driver and navigator roles.  While as the driver, we would focus on trying to solve the problem at hand, and as the navigator, it was a research and refine role, where if the driver needed outside resources, the navigator could get them to prevent unecessary down time from coding.  
## What went well?
We both of us being around the same skill set, I think we helped each other learn quite a bit, when I was the driver I would think and code out loud so that my partner would know my thought process and could correct me if I were to make an error.
## What would you do differently?
I would implement time-boxing towards our struggles.  There were times where we both were struggling with how to approach an issue and just sat on it for too long instead of looking for outside assistance.  Also, my partner was not too confident (as am I as well), but this resulted in them typing out their code very slowly.  So as navigator, I would sometime become a 'backseat driver' and start explaining what needs to be done.  I wish that we had more time so I could've let them go at their own pace and I could guide them differently.
