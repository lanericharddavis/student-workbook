# Pair Programming

## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is just what it sounds like.  Two people working as a pair on programming.  Two people, one computer.  The person on the keyboard is called the 'driver' and they are focusing on the specific task at hand.  The other is called the 'navigator' and is actively involved in the programming but is focusing on overall direction.  These roles swap every so often.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
There are a few benefits of pair programming.  It can increase code quality; when you are coding with another person, there are literally two minds working together and twice as many eyes to catch something the other may have missed, plus if the skill level of one is greater than the other, it is a wonderful way for teaching.  Also, as a team, one person can attend or take care of external prompts while the other keeps in the code.


## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
While there is the benefit of a teaching oppotunity with pair programming, there is also the chance of one side of the pair not carrying their weight in the project and constantly having the other having to catch up where the other lacked.
