## What is a nested route?
Nested routes are when components are nested inside each other; children elements inside parent elements.
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
Nested routes are good for organizational purposes, when you need to route components multiple levels deep.  You might see this on a typical website that has a home page along with an about page, and various other pages.  Those pages could possibly have other pages which could in turn have more pages.  So you can see that staying organized in important, and routes help with that.

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Routes can be defined with dynamic segments, such as passing an ID of a specific page, like clicking on a collection of photos to view detail on one in particular.
