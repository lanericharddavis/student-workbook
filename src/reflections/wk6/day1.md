# Day1 | Introduction to VueJS

## What is Component based architecture?
Component based architecture is when you encapsulate individual 'components' of a larger application making them independent micro-systems.  Take facebook for example, the chat window, comment feed, and friends list are all components within the facebook site.  Components interact independently and have their own structure, methods and APIs.
## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
Due to components being independent from each other, they are able to dynamically update the DOM without the need of a page refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole.  Components requires all methods and APIs for that component to exist within it's own structure.  This makes readability easier for developers instead of having to jump around separate files.
## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
Although component based architecture focuses on encapsulation of the component, this can sometimes be a drawback as well.  When using many components, there runs the possibility that readability might realistically become degraded.
