# Unit Testing 

## What is Software Development Testing?
If you were building a bicycle, you would probably want to make sure that the brakes are functional individually before you attach them to the wheels and hope they stop the bike while speeding down a hill.  Testing in software development is as simple as testing individual components seperately before implimenting them together for the full desired outcome.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
If you code out a big block of complex code with out testing, you run the risk of discovering a long list of errors that leave you not knowing exactly what is causing them or even where to start solving the problem.  To prevent following mystery bugs in your code, testing should be broken down into small snippets, testing individual units one by one.  This ensures you that the code that was just written is operational or if an error does pop up, you know exactly where to fix it.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Unit tests are only good on code that they are written for.  If the code changes, the tests will have to be changed as well, or rewritten entirely.
