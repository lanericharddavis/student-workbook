# Scrum for Small Teams

## Why is communication on a small team important?
Communication is of the utmost importance while working in a small team.  If your team does not have a understanding of what the client wants or even what each team member is doing specifically for a sprint, then clarification must be made.  However, a balance must be made from the get-go because having too many stand-ups or meeting can take away valuable time developing, especially in a small team environment.
## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Some adjustments made from tradational sized scrum teams to smaller teams include expanding the scope of communication between all members of the project by incorporating messaging applications such as Slack.  This allowed communication to be streamlined between developers and product owners and stakeholders.
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
The unattainable triangle is a paradox between the speed of development and the quality of the product delivered.  There are three tenants to this:  GOOD service CHEAP won't be FAST, GOOD service FAST won't be CHEAP, and FAST service CHEAP won't be GOOD.
